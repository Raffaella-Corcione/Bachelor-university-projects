# Bachelor-university-projects
This repository contains the projects I made during my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Politecnico di Milano. 

## 1. Data Structures and Algorithms Project (API)
_Language_: C <br>
_Year_: 2023/2024 <br>
_Grade_: 30/30 <br>
The aim of this project was to build a system that simulated the organization and running of a bakery, considering recipes, ingredients, supplies, customer orders and deliveries. Taking as input a series of commands such as adding a recipe, refilling the stock of some ingredients or taking an order, the program responds with a corresponding output indicating the result of the action. 
The evauation of the projects was done with an automatic verifier. The grade was determined by the correctness of the output, the time complexity of the algorithms and the amount of memory used by the data structures.

## 2. Logic Networks Project (Reti Logiche)
_Language_: VHDL <br>
_Year_: 2024/2025 <br>
_Grade_: 30L/30 <br>
The aim of this project was to implement a hardware model (specifically an FPGA) to apply a differential filter to a byte sequence read from a memory and write the result on the same memory. The component was tested on many testbenches and the project was evaluated on the correctness of the output and the thoroughness of the report. 

## 3. Software Engineering Project
_Language_: Java <br>
_Year_: 2024/2025 <br>
_Grade_: 30L/30 <br>
This project was developed by me, Virgilio Cusano, Sara Ferrarese and Michele Conficconi. It is a software implementation of the board game _Galaxy Trucker_, distributed by Cranio Creations. The main features are: complete rules of the game, Command Line Interface, Graphical User Interface (made with JavaFX), RMI client-server architecture, Socket client-server architecture, multiple simultaneous games, resilience to client disconnections.

## 4. Web Technologies Project
_Language_: Java, JavaScript <br>
_Year_: 2024/2025 <br>
_Grade_: 28/30 <br>
This project was developed by me and Daniele Confalonieri for the _Tecnologie Informatiche per il Web_ course. The aim was to implement an enterprise web application, both in a pure-HTML and a RIA version, to manage grades and exams in a university setting. For the pure-HTML version, the frontend was developed with HTML and Thymeleaf templating. For the RIA version, some logic was transferred client-side with the use of JavaScript. The backend was developed in Java with the use of Java Servlets. The database was managed with MySQL.
