# Bachelor-university-projects
This repository contains the projects I made during my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Politecnico di Milano. 

## 1. Data Structures and Algorithms Project (API)
Language: C
Year: 2023/2024
Grade: 30/30
The aim of this project was to build a system that simulated the organization and running of a bakery, considering recipes, ingredients, supplies, customer orders and deliveries. Taking as input a series of commands such as adding a recipe, refilling the stock of some ingredients or taking an order, the program responds with a corresponding output indicating the result of the action. 
The evauation of the projects was done with an automatic verifier. The grade was determined by the correctness of the output, the time complexity of the algorithms and the amount of memory used by the data structures.

## 2. Logic Networks Project (Reti Logiche)
Language: VHDL
Year: 2024/2025
Grade: 30L/30
The aim of this project was to implement a hardware model (specifically an FPGA) to apply a differential filter to a byte sequence read from a memory and write the result on the same memory. The component was tested on many testbenches and the project was evaluated on the correctness of the output and the thoroughness of the report.
